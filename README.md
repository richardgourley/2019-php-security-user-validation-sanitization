# 2019 PHP SECURITY - USER VALIDATION AND SECURITY
## Which functions are deprecated in 2019?
## What are the best practices for handling user input in 2019?

The purpose of this repo is to provide a quick guide for functions used in validating and sanitizing user input when working with PHP and databases.

### There are short examples of the results of using each function with different strings.
#### There are notes as comments, regarding when to use each option depending on your app requirements.
#### Deprecated functions are included.
It's a work in progress and I'll keep adding to it through the year as I find new security measures.


TOPICS COVERED
* Validating strings, dates, integers emails and urls.
